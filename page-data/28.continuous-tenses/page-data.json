Therefore we get a past continuous, present continuous and future continuous.</p>\n<p><strong>So what is the continuous tense?</strong>\nWhen an action is in progress, then it is a continuous tense. We add (ing) to the end of the verb to show the action is ongoing. On most verbs we double the last letter before adding (ing).</p>\n<p>Verb + ing = verb (ing)\nRun + n + ing = running</p>\n<h3>Present continuous</h3>\n<p>if an activity is in progress at the moment of speaking, then it is the present continuous. We also need the correct <strong>'be verbs'</strong> in front of the action verb.\nExamples:\nI am running.\nIt is walking.</p>\n<h3>Past continuous</h3>\n<p>If one act was in progress when another act occurred, then is the past continuous. As it is in the past we need to change the <strong>'be verbs'</strong> to the past form.</p>\n<p>So the past of the <strong>'be'</strong> verbs?</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Present</th>\n<th>Past</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Am</td>\n<td>was</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Are</td>\n<td>were</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Is</td>\n<td>was</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Examples:\nI was running.\nThey were playing.</p>\n<h3>Future continuous</h3>\n<p>If an activity will be in progress at a time in the future, then we use the future continuous tense. As it is in the future we need to change the <strong>'be verbs'</strong> to the future form.\nThis is remains <strong>'will be'</strong> for all subjects.</p>\n<p>I will be running.\nWe will be flying.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Tense</th>\n<th>Simple</th>\n<th>Continuous</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Present</td>\n<td>verb(s)</td>\n<td>am/is/are + verb + ing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Past</td>\n<td>verb + ed</td>\n<td>was/were + verb + ing</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Future</td>\n<td>will + verb</td>\n<td>will + be + verb + ing</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"28.continuous-tenses"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216","440568431","63159454"]}
