Therefore we get a present perfect, past perfect and future perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>So what is the perfect tense?</strong>\nWhen an action is completed and finished, then it is a perfect tense. As the verb is completed the action is in the past, and therefore we use the past of the verb. There is a simple rule to change the verb from present to past, you just add (ed) to the verb.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Present</th>\n<th>Past</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Verb + (ed)</td>\n<td>Verb(ed)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Present perfect</h3>\n<p>If an action which took place at an indefinite time in the past and is completed, then we use the present perfect.
