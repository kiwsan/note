## Continuous tenses

The continuous tense is effected by the past, present and the future. Therefore we get a past continuous, present continuous and future continuous.

**So what is the continuous tense?**
When an action is in progress, then it is a continuous tense. We add (ing) to the end of the verb to show the action is ongoing. On most verbs we double the last letter before adding (ing).

Verb + ing = verb (ing)
Run + n + ing = running

### Present continuous
if an activity is in progress at the moment of speaking, then it is the present continuous. We also need the correct **'be verbs'** in front of the action verb.
Examples: 
I am running.
It is walking.

### Past continuous
If one act was in progress when another act occurred, then is the past continuous. As it is in the past we need to change the **'be verbs'** to the past form.

So the past of the **'be'** verbs?

| Present | Past |
|--|--|
| Am | was |
| Are | were |
| Is | was |

Examples: 
I was running.
They were playing.

### Future continuous
If an activity will be in progress at a time in the future, then we use the future continuous tense. As it is in the future we need to change the **'be verbs'** to the future form.
This is remains **'will be'** for all subjects.

I will be running.
We will be flying.

| Tense | Simple | Continuous |
|--|--|--|
| Present | verb(s) | am/is/are + verb + ing |
| Past | verb + ed | was/were + verb + ing |
| Future | will + verb | will + be + verb + ing |
