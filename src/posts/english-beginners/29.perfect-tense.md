## Perfect tense
The perfect tense is effected by the past, present and the future. Therefore we get a present perfect, past perfect and future perfect.

**So what is the perfect tense?**
When an action is completed and finished, then it is a perfect tense. As the verb is completed the action is in the past, and therefore we use the past of the verb. There is a simple rule to change the verb from present to past, you just add (ed) to the verb.

| Present | Past |
|--|--|
| Verb + (ed) | Verb(ed) |

### Present perfect
If an action which took place at an indefinite time in the past and is completed, then we use the present perfect. We use the word **'have'** to suggest the completion of the action. *He/she/it use word* **'has'**.

I have swum a lot.
She has not swum.

### Past perfect
If an activity is completed before another activity or another time in the past, then we use the past perfect tense. As it is the past tense we use the past of **'have'**, which is **'had'**. I had swum a lot, then i went home.

I had run.
She had talked.
It had worked. 

### Future perfect
If an activity will be completed before another time or event in the future, then we use the future perfect tense. As it is the future tense we use the future of **'have'**, which is **'will have'**. I will have swum a lot, before i go home.

I will have run.
She will have talked.
They will have played.
