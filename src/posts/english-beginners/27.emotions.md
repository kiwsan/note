## Emotions

**Be**, Then the **be** verbs follow the subject in the sentence: 
I am, You are, He is, She is, It is, We are, They are

As a recap, the **be** verbs are :
**Am**, **are** and **is**

Examples :
I am a teacher.
He is sleep.
We are happy.

**Negative sentences:**
We insert **not** after the verb.

Examples :
I am not a doctor.
He is not sleepy.
We are not happy.

**Questions sentences, We swap the verb comes first.**

Examples :
Am I a doctor?
Is he sleepy?
Are we happy?

**Express emotions :**
To express an emotion we can either use **'be verbs'** or the action verb feel.

**Examples of be verbs :**
I am happy.
You are sad.
He is angry.
She is scared.
It is shy.
We are exhausted.
They are bored.

You can also use the negative and interrogative forms of the **'be verb'** sentences.

Examples of **feel** :
I feel happy.
You feel sad.
He feels angry.
She feels scared.
It feels shy.
We feel exhausted.
They feel bored.

So how do you ask someone what they are feeling?
Example :
How do you feel?
How are you?

The question is dependent on the subject, if the subject changes then so dose the question.
Example :
How dose he feel?
How is he?
