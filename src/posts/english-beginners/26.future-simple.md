## Future simple
**Verbs** are effected by the time in which the action took place. A verb shows an action or a state of being.

The only rule with present tense is that if the subject is **he/she/it** then an **S** is added to the end of the verb.

Verbs + (S) = Verb(s)
I run`----->`he runs
I swim`--->`she swims
I walk`---->`it walks

## Future tense
When the action has not started yet then we use the future simple tense.

| Present | Future |
|--|--|
| I run | I will run |
| I sleep | I will sleep |

Negative sentences
We insert **not** between the auxiliary verb and main verb.

| Present | Future |
|--|--|
| I not run | I will not run |
| I not sleep | I will not sleep |

Question sentences
We swap the subject and auxiliary verb.

| Future |
|--|
| Will I run? |
| Will I sleep? |

**Be**
When **be verbs** are used, we can still use the Future Simple tense.

| Future |
|--|
| I will be late. |
| She will not be very long. |
| Will they be at school tomorrow? |

> **Note:** (will not = won't)
